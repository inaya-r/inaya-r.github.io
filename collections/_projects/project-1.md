This capstone project centered around building a full backend solution for a fictional beauty & personal care company. The goal was to manage products, inventory, transactions, and suppliers using a normalized relational database paired with RESTful APIs for external access. The project was developed in Java using JDBC for database interaction, and follows REST conventions to ensure modularity and ease of integration with future front-end systems.

---

### Key Features
- Entity-relationship (ER) diagram with 6+ tables (Products, Suppliers, Inventory, Transactions, etc.)
- Fully normalized schema to avoid redundancy and ensure integrity
- Java-based RESTful APIs for real-time CRUD operations
- JDBC for interfacing securely with the PostgreSQL database
- Designed for future extensibility (e.g., could plug in a web or mobile UI)


---

### My Role
- Collaborated with team to design the database schema and ERD from scratch
- Wrote SQL scripts for table creation, relationships, and constraints
- Developed RESTful APIs using Java (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Built unit tests and sample queries for validation

---

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java (with JDBC)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Style**: REST
- **Tools**: pgAdmin, VSCode, Postman
- **Version Control**: GitHub

### 🌟 Featured API: Suggest Restock Levels

**Method:** `SuggestRestockLevels()`  
**Type:** Java RESTful GET  
**Purpose:** Generates smart restock recommendations based on current inventory, reorder thresholds, and stock capacity.

#### 🔍 What It Does
This API evaluates all active products and flags those that:
- Have inventory below their reorder threshold
- Have available room under their max stock capacity

It then calculates how many units should be reordered to bring the product back to optimal stock levels.

#### Logic Highlights
- Compares `Current Inventory` to `Reorder Threshold`
- Caps suggested reorder amount at `Max Stock Capacity`
- Skips inactive or fully stocked products
- Returns actionable suggestions (e.g., “Order 46 units of ‘HydraMist Toner’”)

####  Why It Matters
This endpoint introduces decision-making logic into the backend. It enables the business to automate replenishment workflows and avoid both stockouts and overstocking, making it a critical feature for scalable inventory management.

#### 🖼 Sample Output: Restock Recommendations

Below is sample output generated by the `SuggestRestockLevels()` API. The system flags understocked products and recommends smart reorder amounts based on lead time, demand, and capacity.
