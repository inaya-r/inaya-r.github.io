### Project Overview

This project was created in collaboration with the Issaquah School District’s Online Learning Department to inform administrators, board members, and policy stakeholders. It provides a visual, interactive summary of enrollment data spanning **Fall 2018 to Spring 2024**, using internal data and board presentation materials.

The dashboard features:
- **Trend analysis** of total enrollments over time by semester
- **Completion and credit rates**
- **Breakdowns by course type**, grade level, subject, and school
- **Reasons for enrollment**, both overall and segmented by race/ethnicity
- **Performance metrics** based on grades and credit earning

### My Role

- Designed the dashboard layout and visual flow in Tableau Story format  
- Connected and filtered sensitive student enrollment data using Tableau Prep  
- Created custom visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, table highlights)  
- Aligned data storytelling with board report goals and accessibility needs


---

### Key Findings

- Most enrollments were driven by **learning style preferences** or **course acceleration**  
- **High school students** made up the largest share of enrollments, particularly in Online Health  
- Students from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds showed varying reasons for enrollment, with equity and access as core considerations  
- Courses with “Completed” status and passing grades were used as a proxy to identify credit-earning success
