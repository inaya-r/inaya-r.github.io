# 👋 Hi, I'm Inaya Rizvi

    <p>
      I am passionate about machine learning, civic tech, and building tools that turn complexity into clarity. My work spans predictive modeling, RESTful APIs, and dynamic dashboards — always with the goal of making data meaningful and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Currently, I'm studying **Data Visualization** with minors in **Data Science** and **Computer Science/Software Engineering** at the University of Washington Bothell (Class of 2025). 

I specialize in **translating data-driven insights into decisions**, with an eye for presentation, precision, and impact. But, I'm especially interested in using **ML models to identify patterns, support decisions, and improve access to information** in both public and private sector settings.

## My Edge: Business + Technical Fluency

I thrive at the intersection of analysis and communication. I’ve worked on projects where I:

- Presented enrollment trends and predictions to education stakeholders with no coding background
- Translated messy backend logic into clean, readable terminal tables for internal use
- Designed visual comparisons for state policy data to support civic transparency

Whether it's a SQL query, a Shiny dashboard, or a stakeholder-facing presentation, I focus on **how data is used, not just how it’s stored**.

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, JDBC  
- **Visualization**: R Shiny, Tableau, ggplot2, Streamlit  
- **Tools**: VSCode, GitHub, Postman, ArcGIS Pro
- **Machine Learning**: Ridge/Lasso Regression, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors 
- **Other**: RESTful API development, Git, data storytelling, civic tech
